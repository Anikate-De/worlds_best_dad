# Contributing

😍 Thank you for contributing to World's Best Dad! 😍

## Philosophy

I aim to make World's Best Dad as fast, robust and reliable as possible, while also allowing for extensive customization.

If you spot anywhere that I could trim some expense and improve performance, I will gladly accept new issues or PRs! 😄

## Linting

World's Best Dad source files are linted with [flutter_lints](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_lints). I recommend you to add this dependency in your pubspec.yaml & use it at all times.

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  flutter_lints: ^[latest version] # for e.g. ^2.0.1
```

## Formatting

World's Best Dad source files are formatted with FLutter's Default Code Formatter, see [Formatting Documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/tools/formatting) for more info.

## Git/GitHub workflow

This is my preferred process for opening a PR on GitHub:

1. Fork this repository
2. Create a branch off of `master` for your work: `git checkout -b my-feature-branch`
3. Make some changes, committing them along the way
4. When your changes are ready for review, push your branch: `git push origin my-feature-branch`
5. Create a pull request from your branch to `worlds_best_dad/master`
6. No need to assign the pull request to me, I'll review it when I can
7. When the changes have been reviewed and approved, I will squash and merge for you
